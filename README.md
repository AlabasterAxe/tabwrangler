# Tab Wrangler

Helps you focus by auto-closing tabs that you haven't used in a while.

## Features

* *The Corral*: Stores tabs which have been auto-closed so you can re-open as required.
* *Exclude list*: Provide the urls or domain names of the sites you never want auto-closed.
* *Tab Lock*: Pick open tabs to "lock".  Locked tabs will not be auto-closed.
* *Configurable*: Pick how long a tab should be considered ready to close and how many tabs should
  be open at a minimum.
* *Smart*: Doesn't autoclose pinned tabs, doesn't close all your tabs, just enough to make your
  browser usable.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh

## Usage

1. Click on the icon next to the URL bar
    * Tab Corral
      * Stores tabs which have been auto-closed. Restoring tabs with green leaf icons on their right
        sides will have their full history and scroll positions saved. (Full history restore is
        limited by the browser to the last 25 closed tabs.)
    * Tab Lock
      * Selectively lock tabs which you want to stay open.
      * See the time remaining before each tab will be checked for auto-closing.
    * Options
      * Whitelist certain URLs to never be closed.
      * Set the amount of time to wait before closing inactive tabs.
      * Set the ideal number of tabs to have in your browser.
      * Configure keyboard shortcuts.
